# UI Playground Branch

**WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH**

This branch (`ui-playground`) is for UI and visual experimentation only.

## Rules
1. **Audio Integrity**: Do NOT modify, delete, or rename any files in `/public/audio`.
2. **Logic Protection**: Do NOT modify audio processing scripts, session ordering, or playback logic (e.g., `player.js` core logic).
3. **Source of Truth**: The `master` branch remains the canonical source of truth for the product.

## Purpose
Use this branch to iterate on CSS, layout, typography, and visual components without risking the stability of the core playback experience.
