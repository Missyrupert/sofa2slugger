    <h1>Fight IQ</h1>
    <p class=subtitle>The language of boxing</p>
    <div class=glossary>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Jab</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>A quick, straight punch thrown with your lead hand. The first punch you learn and the last one you master.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>The jab sets everything up. It measures distance, disrupts rhythm, and creates openings for power shots.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Think of flicking a wet towel. The power comes from the snap, not the wind-up. Extend fast, retract faster.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Cross</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>A straight power punch with your rear hand, rotating hips and shoulders through the target.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>This is your hammer. While the jab probes, the cross punishes. The punch that ends exchanges.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Imagine pushing a heavy door with your whole body. Back foot pivots, hip turns, shoulder follows. Power from the ground up.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Hook</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>A curved punch in a horizontal arc, targeting the side of head or body.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Hooks attack angles straight punches cannot reach. They come from the blind spot.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Imagine slamming a door shut with your whole body behind it. Your arm stays bent, elbow locked at 90 degrees. The power comes from your hips snapping round, not your arm swinging.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Uppercut</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>A vertical punch driven upward, targeting chin or body at close range.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>When the straight line is blocked, you go under. Exploits the gap between elbows.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Drop hand, bend knees, drive up. Legs do the work. Standing up fast with fist in the way.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Stance</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>Your foundational position. Feet placement, weight distribution, where hands live.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Everything starts here. Weak stance means weak punches and easy knockdowns.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Feet shoulder-width, staggered. Knees soft. Like standing on a surfboard - stable but ready.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Guard</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>Defensive hand position protecting head and body when not throwing.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Offence gets glory but defence keeps you fighting. Your guard is your seatbelt.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Hands by cheekbones, elbows tucked. Chin down, eyes up. Like holding phones to your ears.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Slip</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>Head movement off centre line, letting punches pass by instead of through.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Blocking absorbs damage. Slipping avoids it and sets up your counter.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Bend at waist, not knees. Two inches is a mile. Small movements, eyes on target.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Roll</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>Bend and rotate to let hooks pass over your head or shoulder.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Hooks come from the side. Rolling takes you under and back up ready to fire.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Duck under a clothesline while walking forward. A U-shape, not straight down-and-up.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Footwork</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>How you move. Stepping, pivoting, cutting angles while staying balanced.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Feet set up everything. Good footwork puts you in range to land, out of range to get hit.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Push, do not step. Never cross feet. Think sliding on ice - smooth, balanced, controlled.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class=term-card>
        <h3 class=term-name>Range</h3>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>What</span><p>Distance between you and target. Long, mid, and close range have different tools.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>Why</span><p>Punches only work at specific distances. Knowing range means knowing which weapon to use.</p></div>
        <div class=term-section><span class=term-label>How</span><p>Jab is your measuring stick. Fully extended is long range. Bent arm is closer.</p></div>
