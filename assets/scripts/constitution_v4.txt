SOFA2SLUGGER — PROGRAMME CONSTITUTION (V4)
=========================================

This document defines the non-negotiable rules governing all scripts, narration,
instruction, pacing, and language in the Sofa2Slugger programme.

All sessions (1–10), the Manifesto (M), and any future expansions must comply.


----------------------------------------------------------------
1. ROLE RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------

VANCE
- Declares meaning, structure, and phases.
- Frames sessions and the programme as a whole.
- Never gives physical instruction.
- Never evaluates or judges the user.
- Never implies observation.
- Must never be interrupted once speaking.
- Appears at session openings and closings only.

MAC
- Gives physical instruction only.
- Explains movements and pacing.
- Never evaluates, judges, or praises the user in Sessions 1–5.
- Never implies he can see, watch, check, or assess the user.
- Never uses evaluative language such as:
  “good”, “nice”, “well done” (Sessions 1–5), “keep it up”.
- Uses neutral, instructional, non-performative language.
- May say “Well done” only from Session 6 onward.


----------------------------------------------------------------
2. SESSION PHASE RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------

SESSIONS 1–4: INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE
- Every new action must explicitly include:
  - What it is
  - Why it exists
  - How to do it
  - When to do it
  - How long to do it
- Pace is slow by default.
- Redundancy is allowed and encouraged.
- Silence is short and framed.
- No assumed prior knowledge.

SESSIONS 5–10: EXPERIENTIAL PHASE
- Instructions assume prior learning.
- Silence may be longer and intentional.
- Flow is prioritised over explanation.
- MAC may say “Well done” only from Session 6 onward.


----------------------------------------------------------------
3. LANGUAGE RULES (GLOBAL)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- No evaluative or judgement-based language in early sessions.
- No performance framing.
- No threat, fear, or pressure language.
- No implication of being watched or assessed.
- No motivational hype or shouting.

Allowed:
- Neutral instructional language.
- Positioning and awareness metaphors.
- Calm life parallels that do not imply danger, failure, or judgement.


----------------------------------------------------------------
4. SAFETY & PERMISSION RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------

These principles must be reinforced, especially in Sessions 1–3:

- The user may pause, repeat, or stop at any time.
- Awkwardness and uncertainty are expected.
- Repetition is success, not failure.
- There is no requirement to keep up or remember everything.


----------------------------------------------------------------
5. ENDING RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Sessions 1–5 must end with: “We’re done.”
- Sessions 6–10 may end with: “Well done.”
- No praise or acknowledgement of performance before Session 6.


----------------------------------------------------------------
6. PRIORITY ORDER
----------------------------------------------------------------

When conflicts arise, resolve them in this order:

1. User safety and permission
2. Role separation (Vance vs Mac)
3. Session phase rules
4. Language rules
5. Stylistic preference

This constitution overrides all prior scripts, habits, or instincts.
