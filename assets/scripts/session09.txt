SESSION 9 — PREPARING THE ROUND (V4)
===================================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Nine.

By now, the work should feel familiar.
Not easy,
but known.

You’ve learned how to stand,
how to move,
how to strike,
and how to protect yourself.

Today is about readiness.

Next session, you’ll move through a full round.
Not constant pressure.
Not every punch.

But the shape of it.
The rhythm of it.

Here is Mac.

Mac here.
Session Nine.

This session prepares you
for longer movement.

You won’t rush.

You’ll work,
then you’ll settle.

We start steady.

MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

This session wasn’t about pushing.
It was about pacing.

You worked.
You settled.
You stayed present.

Well done.

A full round.
Start to finish.
Guided the whole way.

No pressure.
Just presence.

Session Ten is there
when you’re ready.
