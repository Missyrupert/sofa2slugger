SESSION 3 — THE LEAD HOOK (V4)
=============================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Three.

So far, you’ve learned how to stand
and how to reach.

Today, we add a different kind of movement.

Straight punches move through space.
Hooks move around it.

They introduce rotation.
And they change where force comes from.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Three.

Today we add the lead hook.

This punch is shorter.
More compact.

It doesn’t travel far.
It turns.

Before we punch,
we prepare the body.


MAC (WARM-UP — ROTATION)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

This warm-up wakes up rotation.

Think of your body like a lighthouse.
The base stays still.
The top turns smoothly.

After me.
Four at a time.

Rotate left. One.
Rotate right. Two.
Rotate left. Three.
Rotate right. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Return to stance.

MAC (STRAIGHTS — REVIEW)

Before adding anything new,
we reconnect the basics.

Jab.
Cross.

These punches keep the body organised.

After me.
Four at a time.

Jab. Cross. One.
Jab. Cross. Two.
Jab. Cross. Three.
Jab. Cross. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.

Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Hands down briefly if needed.

MAC (LEAD HOOK — WHAT / WHY)

Now the lead hook.

This punch works at close range.

It doesn’t reach forward.
It turns across.

Think of your elbow
moving around the edge of a table.

You don’t swing the arm.
You rotate the body.

Front foot pivots.
Front hip follows.
The arm comes along.

The power comes from turning,
not from effort.


MAC (LEAD HOOK — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Hook. One.
Hook. Two.
Hook. Three.
Hook. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Drop the hands.
Let the shoulders relax.

MAC (COMBINATION — CONTEXT)

Now we connect it.

Jab.
Cross.
Hook.

Straight lines first.
Then around the corner.

Nothing rushed.


MAC (COMBINATION — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Jab. Cross. Hook. One.
Jab. Cross. Hook. Two.
Jab. Cross. Hook. Three.
Jab. Cross. Hook. Four.

Pause.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.

MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

Rotation uses different muscles.
That’s expected.

You’ve added a new shape
to the movement.

We’re done.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Three complete.

You’ve added rotation.
A new way of generating force.

Session Four builds on this
and connects it to power.

It’s there when you’re ready.
