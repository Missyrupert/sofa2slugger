SESSION 4 — REAR HAND POWER (V4)
================================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Four.

You’ve learned how to reach.
You’ve learned how to turn.

Today, we work the side of the body
that delivers force.

Not by trying harder,
but by linking things together.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Four.

Today we focus on the rear side.

The cross,
and the rear uppercut.

These punches don’t come from the arm.
They come from connection.

Feet.
Hips.
Shoulders.

Before we punch,
we warm that connection up.


MAC (WARM-UP — CONNECTION)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

This warm-up links the body together.

Think of your body like a spring.
When it’s aligned,
it releases smoothly.

When it’s misaligned,
it jams.

We move as one piece.

After me.
Four at a time.

Turn. Set. One.
Turn. Set. Two.
Turn. Set. Three.
Turn. Set. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Return to stance.

MAC (CROSS — WHAT / WHY)

Rear hand.
The cross.

This punch travels straight,
but it’s driven diagonally.

The back foot presses.
The hip turns.
The shoulder follows.

The arm stays relaxed.

You’re unwinding the body,
not throwing the arm.


MAC (CROSS — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Cross. One.
Cross. Two.
Cross. Three.
Cross. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Shake the arms out.


[3s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (REAR UPPERCUT — WHAT / WHY)

Now the rear uppercut.

This punch moves upward,
but it starts by settling down.

Think of an elevator.

It drops slightly,
then rises straight up.

The elbow stays close.
The palm faces you.

The legs start the movement.
The arm follows.


MAC (REAR UPPERCUT — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Uppercut. One.
Uppercut. Two.
Uppercut. Three.
Uppercut. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Hands down briefly if needed.

MAC (COMBINATION — CONTEXT)

Now we connect it.

Jab.
Cross.
Rear uppercut.

Straight.
Straight.
Up the middle.

Nothing forced.
Nothing fast.


MAC (COMBINATION — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Jab. Cross. Uppercut. One.
Jab. Cross. Uppercut. Two.
Jab. Cross. Uppercut. Three.
Jab. Cross. Uppercut. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

Power comes from alignment,
not effort.

You’ve linked the body together.

We’re done.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Four complete.

You’ve learned how force is organised,
not forced.

Session Five introduces defence
and awareness.

It’s there when you’re ready.
