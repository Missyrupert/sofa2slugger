SESSION 7 — ANGLES (V4)
======================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Seven.

Up to now, you’ve learned how to stand,
how to protect yourself,
and how to respond.

Today, we change position.

Angles alter the conversation.
They put you somewhere unexpected.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Seven.

Today we work angles.

That means turning,
not backing away.

Before we start,
one clarification.

When I say lead hand,
I mean your front hand.
The one closest to what’s in front of you.

We warm up first.


MAC (WARM-UP — TURNING)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

This warm-up wakes up turning movement.

Think of looking over your shoulder.
The feet stay grounded.
The body turns smoothly.

After me.
Four at a time.

Turn left. One.
Turn right. Two.
Turn left. Three.
Turn right. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Reset in stance.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (LEAD UPPERCUT — WHAT / WHY)

Now the lead uppercut.

This punch works at close range,
when there isn’t space for long punches.

It travels up the middle.

The lead shoulder dips slightly.
The punch rises straight.

Compact.
Direct.


MAC (LEAD UPPERCUT — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Uppercut. One.
Uppercut. Two.
Uppercut. Three.
Uppercut. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Hands down briefly if needed.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (PIVOT — WHAT / WHY)

Now the pivot.

This is how you change position
without backing away.

The lead foot stays planted.
That’s your anchor.

The rear foot swings around.
You turn, not step.

Think of opening a side door
instead of forcing forward.


MAC (PIVOT — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Jab. Pivot. One.
Jab. Pivot. Two.
Jab. Pivot. Three.
Jab. Pivot. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Stay balanced.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (CHECK HOOK — CONTEXT)

Now we connect turning with striking.

As you pivot,
the hook meets what’s moving toward you.

You don’t chase.
You let them step into it.

Hook and turn,
together.


MAC (CHECK HOOK — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Hook. Pivot. One.
Hook. Pivot. Two.
Hook. Pivot. Three.
Hook. Pivot. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.


[5s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

You changed position
without rushing.

You learned how to turn
and stay organised.

Well done.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Seven complete.

You’re no longer fixed in one place.
You’re shaping the space around you.

Session Eight brings pressure back in,
carefully.

It’s there when you’re ready.
