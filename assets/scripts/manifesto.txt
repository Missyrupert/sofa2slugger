M — THE MANIFESTO
================

VANCE

This is Sofa to Slugger.

Before anything else, there are a few things you need to know.

You don’t need experience to be here.
You don’t need fitness.
You don’t need speed, power, or confidence.

You don’t need to prove anything.

This is not a test.
It’s a practice.

Everything in this programme is designed to be self-paced.
That means you decide the speed.
You decide the effort.
You decide when to pause, repeat, or stop.

If something feels unfamiliar, awkward, or slow,
that’s not a problem.
That’s expected.

If something feels wrong in your body,
you stop.
No pushing through.
No forcing.
You can always return when you’re ready.

Boxing is often shown as chaos.
But it isn’t.

It’s structure.
It’s timing.
It’s learning where your body is,
and how to move it with intent.

This programme has phases.

In the early sessions,
you’ll be guided closely.
Movements will be broken down.
Instructions will be repeated.
Nothing is rushed.

Later, the guidance will ease.
There will be more space.
More silence.
That isn’t because you’re being tested.
It’s because you’re being trusted to explore.

Repetition here is success.
Doing the same session again is not going backwards.
It’s how this work is meant to be done.

You are not meant to keep up perfectly.
You are not meant to remember everything at once.

You are meant to listen,
try,
and notice.

There is no judgement in this process.
No scoring.
No comparison.

Just you,
your attention,
and the work in front of you.

In a moment, you’ll hear Mac.

Mac is your coach.
His job is not to push you.
His job is to guide you.

When he speaks, follow along at your own pace.
When there is silence, use it.
That space is part of the training.

This is where we start.

Here is Mac.
