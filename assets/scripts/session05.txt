SESSION 5 — DEFENCE & AWARENESS (V4)
===================================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Five.

So far, you’ve learned how to move
and how to generate force.

Today, we focus on staying organised
while you do it.

Defence is not retreat.
It’s awareness.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Five.

Today is about defence.

Not panic.
Not covering up.

Small movements.
Clear attention.

If any of this feels unfamiliar,
that’s expected.

We keep it simple.


MAC (WARM-UP — HEAD MOVEMENT)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

This warm-up wakes up the legs and head.

The body stays tall.
The head moves just enough.

After me.
Four at a time.

Slip left. One.
Slip right. Two.
Slip left. Three.
Slip right. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Stay loose.

MAC (SLIP — WHAT / WHY)

When you slip,
you’re not ducking.

You’re letting a punch miss.

The knees bend slightly.
The head moves off the centre line.

Your eyes stay forward.
Your balance stays under you.

This keeps you ready to move again.


MAC (SLIP — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Slip left. One.
Slip right. Two.
Slip left. Three.
Slip right. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Shake the arms out.


[3s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (ROLL — WHAT / WHY)

Now the roll.

This deals with hooks.

You’re not folding at the waist.
You’re changing level.

The knees bend.
The hips turn.
The head passes underneath.

The movement stays smooth,
not deep.


MAC (ROLL — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.
Four at a time.

Roll left. One.
Roll right. Two.
Roll left. Three.
Roll right. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Hands down briefly if needed.

MAC (DEFENCE → RESPONSE — CONTEXT)

Defence matters
because it creates position.

When you move your head,
your body is already set to respond.

Slip.
Cross.

Nothing forced.
Just available.


MAC (DEFENCE → RESPONSE — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Slip. Cross. One.
Slip. Cross. Two.
Slip. Cross. Three.
Slip. Cross. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.

MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

Awareness takes practice.
It develops over time.

This session was about noticing
and staying organised.

We’re done.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Five complete.

You’re no longer just moving.
You’re paying attention.

From here on,
defence and offence start to blend.

Session Six builds on this
and adds response.

It’s there when you’re ready.
