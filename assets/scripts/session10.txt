SESSION 10 — THE ROUND (V4)
==========================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Ten.

You’ve come a long way to get here.

You didn’t rush.
You didn’t skip ahead.
You stayed with the work.

Today is not harder.
Not faster.

It’s complete.

You’ll move through a full round.
Guided the whole way.

Nothing to prove.
Nothing to survive.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Ten.

Before the round,
we warm up.

Nothing heavy.
Nothing rushed.

We prepare the body
to move continuously.


MAC (WARM-UP — SETTLING IN)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

We ease in.

Jab.
Reset.

After me.
Four at a time.

Jab. Reset. One.
Jab. Reset. Two.
Jab. Reset. Three.
Jab. Reset. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Take a breath.
Stay loose.

MAC (PRE-ROUND — CONTEXT)

Before the bell,
take a moment.

This is a full round.

You’ve learned how to stand.
How to move.
How to protect yourself.
How to respond.

Whatever pace you choose,
it’s enough.

Stay present.
Trust the work.

When the bell rings,
we move together.

MAC (COOLDOWN)

Let the arms hang.

Breathe.

That was a full round.
Start to finish.

You stayed present.
You stayed organised.

Well done.

I’m signing off.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Ten complete.

You didn’t just train.
You followed something through.

That takes patience.
It takes attention.

Thank you for trusting this process
and for supporting the work behind it.

If this helped you,
and you know someone who might benefit,
you can tell them about it.

No obligation.
Just a quiet recommendation.

Take care of yourself.

This round is over.
The work stays with you.
