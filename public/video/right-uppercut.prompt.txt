A realistic, high-quality instructional video clip. Medium shot. An athletic male boxer in an orthodox stance (left foot forward) performs a single RIGHT UPPERCUT. He drops his hips slightly and drives the right fist upward, rotating the rear hip. The left hand remains high and tight against the face. He resets to stance immediately. No follow-up punches, no bobbing. The environment is a clean, minimal boxing gym. The boxer wears shorts featuring a large, distinct "S2S" logo with red number '2'. A subtle 'Sofa2Slugger' logo is visible on the gym wall. Neutral lighting. No text overlays. Real-time speed.  The boxer should be seen crouching down then bringing the punch up
