SESSION 1 — FOUNDATIONS (V4 - PATCHED)
=====================================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session One.

You are not here to perform.
You are here to learn how to begin.

Nothing in this session is about speed.
Nothing is about power.

Today is about position.
About understanding where your body is,
and how to place it with intent.

This session sets the base.
Everything that follows rests on this.

Here is Mac.


[4s MUSIC GAP — VANCE → MAC]


MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session One.

This session is instructional.

I’ll explain what we’re doing,
why we’re doing it,
how to do it,
and how long to stay there.

There’s no rush.
If you pause or repeat,
that’s part of the work.

We start with stance.


MAC (STANCE — WHAT / WHY)

This is your stance.

Your stance is the position
everything else comes from.

If this feels stable,
movement becomes easier later.

Place your feet like train tracks.
Side by side,
not one in front of the other.

Front foot points forward.
Back foot turns out slightly.

Soften the knees.
Let your weight sit evenly.

You should feel balanced.
Not tense.
Not leaning.

Hold this.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (STANCE — CHECK)

Notice your balance.

If you feel wobbly,
widen the tracks slightly.

If your legs feel locked,
soften the knees again.

Stay there.

This is the position we return to.


[2s MUSIC GAP]


MAC (GUARD — WHAT / WHY)

Now the guard.

In boxing, the guard protects your head.
More than that,
it protects your attention.

When the guard drops,
things slip through.
Punches in boxing.
Problems in life.

Not because of weakness,
but because awareness faded.

So this isn’t tension.
It’s readiness.

Bring your hands up
to about cheek level.

Imagine resting them
on invisible shelves.

Elbows in.
Shoulders relaxed.

Once the guard is set,
it stays set.

You’re not lifting and dropping the hands.
You’re placing them
and keeping them there.


[2s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (RESET — DEFINITION)

From now on,
after every punch,
the hands return to the guard.

When I say "back to guard,"
it means check your feet,
and check your hands.

You start there,
you finish there.


[3s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (NUMBERS — SIGNPOSTING)

Later in the program,
I will use numbers to call punches.

One means Jab.
Two means Cross.

We won’t use them today.
Just focus on the names of the leads.


MAC (THE JAB — WHAT / WHY)

This is your first punch.
The jab.

The jab controls space.
It lets you reach
without committing your body.

It’s not about power.
It’s about placement and timing.

Front hand.
Straight out.
Straight back.

Think loose.
Like snapping a towel.

The arm moves.
The body stays calm.


MAC (THE JAB — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Pause.

Again.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Pause.

Last set.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

Jab.
Back to guard.

And stop.

Hands down.
Reset the shoulders.


[3s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (THE CROSS — WHAT / WHY)

Now the second punch.
The cross.

This punch uses the body.

Power comes from connection,
not from swinging the arm.

Back foot presses lightly.
The hip turns.
The shoulder follows.

The arm comes along.


MAC (THE CROSS — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Pause.

Again.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Pause.

Last set.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

Cross.
Back to guard.

And stop.

Shake the arms out.


[3s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (JAB–CROSS — WHAT / WHY)

Now we connect them.

The jab creates space.
The cross travels through it.

Nothing forced.
Nothing fast.

Just clean movement.


MAC (JAB–CROSS — HOW / HOW LONG)

After me.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Pause.

Again.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Pause.

Last set.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

Jab. Cross.
Back to guard.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

If this felt simple,
that’s intentional.

If it felt awkward,
that’s expected.

You’ve placed your body.
You’ve learned where things begin.

We’re done.


[5s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session One complete.

You’ve set the base.
Nothing rushed.
Nothing added.

Session Two builds gently from here.
Same pieces.
Cleaner movement.

It’s there when you’re ready.
