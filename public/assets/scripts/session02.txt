SESSION 2 — BUILDING FLOW (V4)
=============================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Two.

You’ve learned how to place your body.
You’ve learned how to reach.

Today is about connection.

Not power.
Not speed.

Flow.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Two.

This session builds on what you learned last time.

Nothing new yet.
Same stance.
Same guard.
Same punches.

The difference today is how they connect.

We start by returning to stance.


MAC (STANCE — RESET)

Set your stance.

Train tracks.
Not a tightrope.

Front foot forward.
Back foot turned slightly.

Knees soft.
Weight balanced.

Hold this.

This is your base.
We always come back here.


[3s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (GUARD — RESET)

Bring the hands up.

Cheek level.
Elbows in.
Shoulders relaxed.

This isn’t tension.
It’s readiness.

Once the guard is set,
leave it there.

It keeps things where you want them.

This punch connects the body to the arm.

Back foot presses.
Hip turns.
Shoulder follows.

The arm stays relaxed.

The cross travels through it.

Nothing rushed.
Just clean movement.

MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

This session was about connection.
About letting movements follow each other.

We’re done.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]


VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Two complete.

You’re no longer working in pieces.
You’re learning how they link.

Session Three adds a new shape.
A different kind of movement.

It’s there when you’re ready.
