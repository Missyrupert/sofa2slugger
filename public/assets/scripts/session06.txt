SESSION 6 — ACTIVE DEFENCE (V4)
==============================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Six.

You’ve learned how to avoid punches.
You’ve learned how to stay balanced.

Today, defence becomes movement.
Not an ending,
but the beginning of the next action.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Six.

Today we make defence active.

You won’t stay still after you move.
You’ll respond.

Nothing rushed.
Nothing wild.

If this feels like a step up,
that’s expected.


MAC (WARM-UP — LEVEL CHANGE)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

We warm up level changes.

Think of riding gentle waves.
You rise.
You fall.
But you stay centred.

After me.
Four at a time.

Down. Up. One.
Down. Up. Two.
Down. Up. Three.
Down. Up. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Settle back into stance.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (ROLL — RECAP)

Quick reminder on the roll.

This is not a dip of the head.
It’s a bend of the legs.

The back stays tall.
The eyes stay forward.

You move under trouble,
not away from it.


MAC (ROLL — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Roll left. One.
Roll right. Two.
Roll left. Three.
Roll right. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Stay loose.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (ROLL → HOOK — CONTEXT)

Now we add the response.

When you roll,
your body is already loaded.

Like drawing back a rubber band.
You don’t pause.
You release.

Roll.
Hook.


MAC (ROLL → HOOK — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Roll. Hook. One.
Roll. Hook. Two.
Roll. Hook. Three.
Roll. Hook. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Hands down briefly if needed.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (ROLL → CROSS — CONTEXT)

Same idea.
Different exit.

Roll the other way.
The cross travels straight through.

You meet the opening.
You don’t chase it.


MAC (ROLL → CROSS — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Roll. Cross. One.
Roll. Cross. Two.
Roll. Cross. Three.
Roll. Cross. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Shake the arms out.


[4s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (ACTIVE DEFENCE — FLOW)

Now we flow it.

Slip.
Roll.
Punch.

One movement.
Then the next.

After me.
Four at a time.

Slip. Roll. Hook. One.
Slip. Roll. Hook. Two.
Slip. Roll. Hook. Three.
Slip. Roll. Hook. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.


[5s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

Defence is no longer a pause.
It’s part of the movement.

You stayed organised.
You responded.

Well done.

VANCE (OUTRO)

Session Six complete.

You’re beginning to choose your moments,
not just react to them.

Session Seven introduces angles
and changes of position.

It’s there when you’re ready.
