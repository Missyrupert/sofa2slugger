SESSION 8 — BODY WORK (V4)
=========================

VANCE (INTRO)

This is Session Eight.

So far, most of the work has stayed high.

Today, we change levels.

The body is a larger target.
It moves differently.
It responds over time.

This session introduces body work,
carefully.

Here is Mac.

MAC (INTRO)

Mac here.
Session Eight.

Today is about body shots.

We don’t punch down with the arms.
We change level with the legs.

Nothing rushed.
Nothing forced.

We warm up first.


MAC (WARM-UP — LEVEL CHANGE)

Set your stance.
Hands up.

This warm-up prepares the legs
to change height.

Keep the back tall.
Let the knees bend.

After me.
Four at a time.

Down. Up. One.
Down. Up. Two.
Down. Up. Three.
Down. Up. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Stay tall.

MAC (JAB TO BODY — CONTEXT)

Now the jab to the body.

This punch reaches lower,
but the head stays protected.

You step in slightly.
You bend the knees.
You send the jab straight in.

The other hand stays high.
Your balance stays under you.


MAC (JAB TO BODY — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Jab to body. One.
Jab to body. Two.
Jab to body. Three.
Jab to body. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Reset in stance.


[5s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (CROSS TO BODY — CONTEXT)

Now the cross to the body.

Same idea.
Different side.

You step across slightly.
You change level.
You send the cross in straight.

This punch commits the body,
so balance matters.


MAC (CROSS TO BODY — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Cross to body. One.
Cross to body. Two.
Cross to body. Three.
Cross to body. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Shake the arms out.


[5s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (HEAD–BODY–HEAD — CONTEXT)

Now we connect levels.

High.
Low.
High.

Jab to the head.
Cross to the body.
Hook to the head.

The legs change height.
The hands follow.


MAC (HEAD–BODY–HEAD — PRACTICE)

After me.
Four at a time.

Head. Body. Head. One.
Head. Body. Head. Two.
Head. Body. Head. Three.
Head. Body. Head. Four.

Pause.

Again.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Pause.

Last set.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

And stop.

Let the arms hang.


[6s QUIET PAUSE]


MAC (COOLDOWN)

Take a breath.

Body work isn’t about instant effect.
It builds over time.

You changed levels.
You stayed organised.

Well done.


[4s MUSIC GAP — MAC → VANCE]

You’ve added another layer.
High and low.
Head and body.

Two sessions remain.

for a full round.

It’s there when you’re ready.
