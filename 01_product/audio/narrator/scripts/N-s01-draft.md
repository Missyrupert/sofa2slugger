# Narrator Scripts - Session 01

## Intro
Welcome to Session 1. This is where we begin.
Today is about the Stance. The foundation of everything you will do in boxing.
You need clear space. You need to be able to move your feet.
If you are ready, stand tall. Let's work.

## Outro
Session 1 is complete. You have your stance. You have broken the inertia.
This was the hardest step. The decision to start.
If you enjoyed this, Session 2 introduces the Jab—the most important punch in boxing.
To continue, unlock the full programme. A single payment. Yours forever.
Move the body. The mind follows.
Stay safe, and take care.
