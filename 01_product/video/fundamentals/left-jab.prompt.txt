A realistic, high-quality instructional video clip. Medium shot. An athletic male boxer in an orthodox stance (left foot forward) performs a single, perfect LEFT JAB. The left hand extends straight out and snaps back to the chin. The rear hand (right) remains tight against the jaw. The boxer does not move his feet significantly, just a small weight transfer. No follow-up punches, no head movement, no extra weaving. The environment is a clean, minimal boxing gym. The boxer wears shorts featuring a large, distinct red number '2'. A subtle 'Sofa2Slugger' logo is visible on the gym wall. Neutral lighting. No text overlays. Real-time speed.
