A realistic, high-quality instructional video clip. Medium shot. An athletic male boxer in an orthodox stance (left foot forward) performs a single LEFT HOOK. He pivots on his lead foot, rotating his hips, with the left arm bent at 90 degrees parallel to the floor. The right hand remains glued to the chin for protection. He returns to stance immediately. No combinations, no extra movement. The environment is a clean, minimal boxing gym. The boxer wears shorts featuring a large, distinct red number '2'. A subtle 'Sofa2Slugger' logo is visible on the gym wall. Neutral lighting. No text overlays. Real-time speed.
