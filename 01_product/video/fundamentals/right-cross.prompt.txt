A realistic, high-quality instructional video clip. Medium shot. An athletic male boxer in an orthodox stance (left foot forward) performs a single, powerful RIGHT CROSS. The right hand is thrown straight from the chin, with full extension and hip rotation, while the left hand stays tight directly protecting the face. The punch retracts immediately. No flurries, no second punch. The environment is a clean, minimal boxing gym. The boxer wears shorts featuring a large, distinct red number '2'. A subtle 'Sofa2Slugger' logo is visible on the gym wall. Neutral lighting. No text overlays. Real-time speed.
