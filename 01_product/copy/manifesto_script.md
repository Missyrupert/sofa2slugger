Move the body first. Thinking follows.

Sofa2Slugger is an audio-first experience designed to interrupt inaction and return you to physical agency.

It is for those who feel stuck, stalled, or dulled by comfort.

It is not therapy. It is not motivation. It is structured, embodied action.

Headphones on. No screens. Body moving.
