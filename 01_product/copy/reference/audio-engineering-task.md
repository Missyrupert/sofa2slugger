# Audio Engineering Task: Intelligibility & Mix

## 1. Problem Statement
- Music occasionally masks spoken instruction.
- Issue is **intelligibility**, not tone, taste, or performance.
- The core product value (instruction) is being obstructed by the audio mix.

## 2. Scope of Work (INCLUDED)
- **Voice/music level balancing**: Ensure voice sits clearly above the music bed.
- **Ducking**: Implement sidechain compression or volume automation to duck music under voice.
- **EQ separation**: Carve out frequencies in the music to prioritise speech clarity/presence.
- **Consistency**: Apply standardized processing chain across all sessions.

## 3. Explicit Exclusions (NOT ALLOWED)
- **No script changes**: The words remain exactly as they are.
- **No voice replacement**: Do not re-record or swap voices.
- **No new music**: Use existing tracks only.
- **No user-selectable options**: No volume sliders or "custom music" features.
- **No structural changes**: Do not alter timing, sequence, or session length.

## 4. Success Criteria
- Spoken instruction is always intelligible without effort or volume adjustment.
- Music remains present and atmospheric but **never** competes with the voice.
- Fix applies globally; the experience is uniform across the entire programme.

## 5. Guardrails
- **Audio-first intimacy must be preserved**: Do not make it sound like a generic fitness app.
- **No “polish” for its own sake**: Changes must solve the intelligibility problem only.
- **No creative reinterpretation**: Do not change the mood or vibe of the sessions.
