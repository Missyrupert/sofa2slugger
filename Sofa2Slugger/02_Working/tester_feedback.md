### Synthesised Findings

#### 1. Language & Cognitive Load
- **Number System Friction**: Finding that converting numbers (1-2-3) to movements (Jab-Cross-Hook) in real-time is difficult for some users ("not the most attentive").
  - *Preference*: Descriptive commands ("Jab, Cross, Hook") over numerical abstraction.
  - *Risk*: Users losing track or getting confused by pure number sequences.

#### 2. Instructional Mechanics
- **The "One-Two" Anchor**:
  - Feedback that the 1-2 (Jab-Cross) is the non-negotiable foundation of *all* boxing.
  - *Critical adjustment*: Combinations (hooks, uppercuts) should be taught as *extensions* of the 1-2 (e.g., "One-two, Left Hook"), not as isolated punches.
- **"Pause & Check" (Sessions 1-3)**:
  - Requirement for a hard stop in early drills: "Throw 1-2. Hold. Look at your hands. Are they back at guard?"
  - Use this to strictly enforce the return-to-guard habit before speed is allowed.

#### 3. Progression & Intensity
- **The Speed Bridge**: Users feel a gap between "learning slow" and "going fast". Need explicit permission/instruction to transition from technique to intensity.
- **Volume Expectation**: Users equate value ("10 notes") with physical exertion. Ending on a "pedestrian pace" feels underwhelming.
  - *Need*: "Quickfire" triggers or "finisher" segments where they are told to chain attacks as fast as possible.

#### 4. Ethos Checks
- **Confirmed**: "It's not to create the next Floyd Mayweather." (Aligns with "Grounded, unspectacular").
- **Constraint**: Ignore suggestion for praise ("You've got the hang of that"). MAC remains neutral.
